# Project
#What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?


#How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I started by looking at the data that was provided to us as input. I considered every possibility for storing this information. Then I considered every operation I could possibly perform on my data as well as the level of time and spatial complexity that each data structure would provide. I then select the appropriate data structure based on my needs.

#How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

The idea of the problem being broken down into a few carefully thought-out solution components is known as structured design. The design of the solution is essentially at issue. A structured design has the benefit of improving understanding of how the problem is solved. A more accurate focus on the problem is also made simpler for the designer by structured design. 

#How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

The "divide and conquer" strategy, which divides a large problem into several smaller ones that can each be solved on its own before the larger problem is resolved, is the foundation of the systematic design.  Solution modules are used to solve small problems in pieces. The formal design highlights how well-designed these modules are to produce an accurate solution.

#How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
